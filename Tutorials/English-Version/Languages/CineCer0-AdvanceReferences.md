### Hydra in Estuary Vs Hydra website

Hydra in Estuary is a slightly reduced version of its standalone website.  

+ You can check tutorials directly on the Hydra official webpage, such as this: [https://hydra.ojack.xyz/docs/docs/learning/](https://hydra.ojack.xyz/docs/docs/learning/){:target="_blank"}  

Estuary currently has partial access to Hydra functionality. The idioms below are unavailable:

+ Anonymous (global) functions. For example, `() => mouse.x` and `({time}) => time%360`.
+ Audio functions. For example, `a.show()` and `()=>a.fft[1]`
