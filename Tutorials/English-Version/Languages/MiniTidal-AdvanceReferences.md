### TidalCycles Vs MiniTidal

MiniTidal is a slightly reduced version of TidalCycles.  

+ You can check tutorials directly on the TidalCycles official webpage, such as this: [https://tidalcycles.org/docs/patternlib/tutorials/workshop](https://tidalcycles.org/docs/patternlib/tutorials/workshop){:target="_blank"}  

Something important to mention is that the MiniTidal version in Estuary differs slightly from the original Tidal Cycles syntax.  

For example, in Estuary, you can run the following line:

+ `s "cp"`

But in Tidal Cycle’s workshops and references, you will find the the following structures:

+ `d1 $ s “cp"`
+ `once $ s "cp"`

If you use the references and examples from Tidal’s website, do not add structures such as `d1 $` or `once $`.  

Additionally, some functions, such as `feedback` or `room` won’t work.

### Use personalized samples

Using your own samples in Estuary is possible, but it has a work around using GitHub pages. You can follow these tutorials:

+ [GitHub: Setup](../GitHub-setup.md){:target="_blank"}

+ [GitHub: Adding Media Files](../GitHub-addingFiles.md){:target="_blank"}

+ [Estuary: Importing Samples for TidalCycles](../Estuary-ImportingSamples.md){:target="_blank"}
