## Codeworks

In simple terms, a **codework** is a form of creative writing that integrates programming languages within the text (*[Electronic Literature Collection, Volume One](https://collection.eliterature.org/1/aux/keywords.html)*).  

Author **John Cayley** identified categories for classifying codeworks, including:  

+ **"Code infecting or modulating language"**—where the language functions, but the code is broken (*p.311-312*).

The **code-poetry** from Australian artist and poet **[Mez Breeze](https://www.mezbreezedesign.com/)** with **[Mezangelle](https://anthology.rhizome.org/mez-breeze)** fits this category. This work is often described as **non-executable code poetry**.

Mezangelle is a non-functional programming language that poetically merges machine and human languages, reshaping English with code-inspired syntax.

# 🌟 Codework Activity: Writing Code Poetry

## 🎯 Objective:
Explore the intersection of **computer language syntax and poetry** by crafting your own **code-inspired poem** using **CSS syntax** as a creative tool.

## 📌 Activity Overview:
1️⃣ **Class Discussion:** Understanding CSS Syntax & Structure *(Whole Class, 20 min)*
2️⃣ **Code Poetry Writing:** Crafting Your Own Codework *(Pairs, 25 min)*
3️⃣ **Sharing & Discussion:** Analyzing & Reflecting on the Work *(Whole Class, 15 min)*

## 1️⃣ Class Discussion: Understanding CSS Syntax & Structure *(20 min)*

### **What is CSS?**
CSS (**Cascading Style Sheets**) is a language used to **style web pages**, controlling elements like fonts, colors, and layout.
But what if we **repurposed its syntax** for poetry instead of design?

### **Example: CSS as Code Poetry**

```css
body {
    background: darkness;
    font-family: "silence", sans-serif;
    color: #broken;
}

a:hover {
    content: "uncertainty";
    transition: fade-out 2s;
}
```

## 💡 Discussion Questions:
- What programming symbols do you notice?
- How do the selectors (e.g., `body`, `a:hover`) function?
- How does breaking the syntax create poetic meaning?
- If CSS controlled emotions instead of styles, what would you write?

## 2️⃣ Code Poetry Writing: Crafting Your Own Codework *(Pairs, 25 min)*  

### **💻 Task: Write a Short Code Poem**  
In **pairs**, create a **code-inspired poem** using CSS syntax as your foundation.  

✅ **Use at least three elements** from CSS (selectors, properties, values).  
✅ **Choose a theme** (e.g., memory, glitch, loss, love, repetition).  
✅ **Break the syntax if needed**—prioritize meaning over functionality.  

### **Example Code Poetry (For Inspiration)**

```css
body {
    background: life;
    my-family: "forgotten", "lost";
    text-continues: justify;
    display: none;
}
```

## 3️⃣ Sharing & Discussion: Reading & Analyzing Code Poetry *(Whole Class, 15 min)*  

- 🔹 **Upload your code poem** to Dropbox (link provided).  
- 🔹 I will **open 2-3 examples** for the class to discuss.  

### 💡 Discussion Questions:
- How does this piece **play with syntax**?  
- What **emotions or themes** emerge from the code?  
- Could this be **read in multiple ways**?  

---

## 🎯 Wrap-Up:
- 🔸 **Code poetry blurs the boundaries** between language, programming, and creative expression.  
- 🔸 **Programming syntax can be a poetic structure**—it doesn't need to function, only to evoke meaning.  
- 🔸 **How else could digital language be repurposed for creative writing?**
